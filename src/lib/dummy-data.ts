The process takes 2-4 weeks from appointment to receiving your number.",

      title: "What is an NIE?",
      content: "The NIE (Número de Identificación de Extranjero) is your foreigner identification number in Spain. You need it for almost everything: opening a bank account, signing a rental contract, starting a job, buying property, or even getting a phone contract.",

      title: "Step 1: Book Your Appointment",

      content: "Before your appointment, pay the €12 fee at any Spanish bank. Download Modelo 790, code 012, fill it out, and pay at the bank. Keep the stamped receipt - they won't process you without it.",

      question: "How long does it take to get an NIE appointment in Barcelona?",
      answer: "Appointments are released daily but fill up within minutes. Most people wait 2-4 weeks to secure a slot. Check at midnight for the best availability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I apply for an NIE before arriving in Spain?",
      answer: "Yes, you can apply at a Spanish consulate in your home country, but the process is often slower. Many expats prefer to wait and apply directly in Barcelona.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between NIE and TIE?",
      answer: "The NIE is just a number for identification. The TIE (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero) is a physical card that non-EU residents need after staying more than 6 months.",

    {
      question: "Do I need to speak Spanish at the NIE appointment?",
      answer: "It helps, but many officers speak basic English. Our premium templates include Spanish scripts to help you communicate clearly.",
    },
  ],
  personalExperience: "When we applied for our NIE, the officer asked for documents that weren't on the official list. We learned to always bring extra copies of everything—it saved us twice. Also, the online system crashed three times before we finally got our appointment. Start trying well before you actually need the NIE.",
